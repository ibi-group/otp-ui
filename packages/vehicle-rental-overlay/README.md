# Vehicle Rental Overlay

## Upgrade to OTP2 types

Version 5.0.1 is the final version to support OTP1 types for the `stations` prop of `VehicleRentalOverlay`. Starting with version 6.0.0, the type for `stations` will be updated from `Station[]` to `VehicleRentalStation[]`. This updated type can be found in the `@opentripplanner/types/otp2` package.
